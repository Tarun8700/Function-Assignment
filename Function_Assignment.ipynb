        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, the terms *function* and *method* both refer to callable objects that perform operations, but they are used in different contexts and have a few key differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Definition and Context:**\n",
        "   - **Function**: A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It can be defined independently, outside of any class or object.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     def my_function(x):\n",
        "         return x + 1\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Method**: A method is a function that is associated with an object or a class. It is defined within a class and is designed to operate on instances of that class or the class itself. When called, it automatically receives the instance (`self`) or the class (`cls`) as its first argument.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     class MyClass:\n",
        "         def my_method(self, x):\n",
        "             return x + 1\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Binding:**\n",
        "   - **Function**: Functions are generally standalone and not tied to any object or class.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     result = my_function(5)  # Function call\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Method**: Methods are bound to objects or classes. When you call a method, it is implicitly called on an object, and it usually operates on that object's attributes or modifies its state.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     obj = MyClass()\n",
        "     result = obj.my_method(5)  # Method call\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Implicit Argument:**\n",
        "   - **Function**: A function does not have an implicit first argument. When you call a function, you pass all the arguments explicitly.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     result = my_function(5)  # Argument passed directly\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Method**: A method automatically takes its first argument as the instance (`self`) or class (`cls`) of the object on which it is called. You do not need to pass this argument explicitly when calling the method.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     obj = MyClass()\n",
        "     result = obj.my_method(5)  # `self` is automatically passed\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Function Example:**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def add(x, y):\n",

        "\n",
        "   result = add(3, 4)  # Calling the function\n",
        "   print(result)  # Output: 7\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Method Example:**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Calculator:\n",
        "       def add(self, x, y):\n",
        "           return x + y\n",

        "   print(result)  # Output: 7\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Function**: A block of code that is not tied to a class or object. It is called with arguments and does not automatically receive an instance or class.\n",
        "- **Method**: A function that is tied to an object or class. It is called on an instance or class, and it automatically receives the object (`self`) or class (`cls`) as its first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, **function arguments** and **parameters** refer to the values passed into a function and the variables used to represent those values within the function. While the terms are often used interchangeably, they have distinct meanings when we talk about defining and calling functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Parameters:**\n",
        "Parameters are the variables that are listed in the function definition. They act as placeholders for the values that will be passed to the function when it is called.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Function Definition:** When defining a function, you specify **parameters** in the parentheses.\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  def greet(name, age):\n",
        "      print(f\"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old!\")\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "In the above example, `name` and `age` are parameters. They represent the data that the function expects when it is called.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Arguments:**\n",
        "Arguments are the actual values you provide when calling a function. These are the data that will be passed into the function to match the parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Function Call:** When you call the function, you provide **arguments**.\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  greet(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "In this example:\n",
        "- `\"Alice\"` is an **argument** passed to the `name` parameter.\n",
        "- `30` is an **argument** passed to the `age` parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Differences:\n",
        "- **Parameters** are variables in the function definition (like placeholders).\n",
        "- **Arguments** are the actual values you provide when calling the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Types of Function Arguments:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Python supports different ways of passing arguments to a function:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### A. **Positional Arguments**\n",
        "These are the most common form of arguments. The values are assigned to parameters based on their position in the function call.\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  def add(a, b):\n",
        "      return a + b\n",
        "\n",
        "  result = add(2, 3)  # 2 goes to a, 3 goes to b\n",
        "  print(result)  # Output: 5\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "In the above example, `2` is assigned to `a`, and `3` is assigned to `b` based on their positions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### B. **Keyword Arguments**\n",
        "These allow you to pass arguments by explicitly naming the parameter in the function call. This makes the function call more readable and flexible, as the order of arguments doesn't matter.\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  def greet(name, age):\n",
        "      print(f\"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  greet(name=\"Alice\", age=30)  # Using keyword arguments\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, `name=\"Alice\"` and `age=30` are keyword arguments. The function call can still work even if the arguments are passed in a different order:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  greet(age=30, name=\"Alice\")\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### C. **Default Arguments**\n",
        "These are parameters that have default values specified in the function definition. If an argument is not provided for a parameter with a default, the default value is used.\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  def greet(name=\"Guest\", age=25):\n",
        "      print(f\"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  greet()  # Uses default values\n",
        "  greet(name=\"Alice\")  # Uses default age\n",
        "  greet(name=\"Bob\", age=40)  # Uses provided values\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the parameters `name` and `age` have default values. If the caller does not provide a value for them, the defaults are used.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### D. **Variable-Length Arguments (Arbitrary Arguments)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Arbitrary Positional Arguments (`*args`)**:\n",
        "  When you don't know how many positional arguments might be passed, you can use `*args` to collect them into a tuple.\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  def sum_all(*args):\n",
        "      return sum(args)\n",
        "\n",
        "  print(sum_all(1, 2, 3))  # Output: 6\n",
        "  print(sum_all(10, 20, 30, 40))  # Output: 100\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Arbitrary Keyword Arguments (`**kwargs`)**:\n",
        "  Similarly, `**kwargs` allows you to pass a variable number of keyword arguments. These are collected into a dictionary.\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  def display_info(**kwargs):\n",
        "      for key, value in kwargs.items():\n",
        "          print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  display_info(name=\"Alice\", age=30, city=\"New York\")\n",
        "  # Output:\n",
        "  # name: Alice\n",
        "  # age: 30\n",
        "  # city: New York\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Order of Arguments**\n",
        "When calling a function, you must pass arguments in the correct order, especially when mixing positional, keyword, and default arguments:\n",
        "1. **Positional arguments** must come first.\n",
        "2. **Keyword arguments** follow.\n",
        "3. **Default arguments** are typically provided at the end of the function definition (but can also be overridden by the caller if needed).\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  def foo(a, b=10, c=20):\n",
        "      print(a, b, c)\n",
        "\n",
        "  foo(5)  # Output: 5 10 20\n",
        "  foo(5, c=30)  # Output: 5 10 30\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "In the first call, `b` and `c` take their default values. In the second call, `c` is overridden by the keyword argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Parameters** are the variables in the function definition (e.g., `name` and `age` in `def greet(name, age)`).\n",
        "- **Arguments** are the actual values you pass when calling the function (e.g., `\"Alice\"` and `30` in `greet(\"Alice\", 30)`).\n",
        "- You can pass arguments in different ways: **positional**, **keyword**, and **default** arguments, and use `*args` and `**kwargs` for variable-length arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "This flexibility in Python allows functions to be both easy to call and adaptable to different use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, there are several ways to **define** and **call** functions, each offering different levels of flexibility depending on how you structure the function and its arguments. Below is a breakdown of the different ways to define and call functions in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Defining and Calling a Simple Function**\n",
        "\n",
        "The most basic way to define and call a function is by specifying a function name, parameters (optional), and a body of code. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Definition:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def greet():\n",
        "    print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Call:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "greet()  # Output: Hello, world!\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Function with Parameters**\n",
        "\n",
        "You can define a function with parameters to accept input values.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Definition:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def greet(name):\n",
        "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Call:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "greet(\"Alice\")  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, the function `greet` takes a parameter `name` and prints a greeting using the argument passed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Function with Return Value**\n",
        "\n",
        "Functions can also return values, which you can store in variables or use directly in expressions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Definition:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def add(a, b):\n",
        "    return a + b\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Call:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "result = add(3, 5)  # result = 8\n",
        "print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Function with Default Arguments**\n",
        "\n",
        "You can provide default values for function parameters. If the caller does not pass a value for that parameter, the default is used.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Definition:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def greet(name=\"Guest\"):\n",
        "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Call:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "greet()       # Output: Hello, Guest!\n",
        "greet(\"Bob\")  # Output: Hello, Bob!\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Function with Arbitrary Positional Arguments (`*args`)**\n",
        "\n",
        "If you don't know how many positional arguments a function will receive, you can use `*args` to collect them into a tuple.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Definition:**\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Call:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "print(sum_all(1, 2, 3))     # Output: 6\n",
        "print(sum_all(10, 20, 30))  # Output: 60\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, `*args` collects all positional arguments into a tuple, and `sum(args)` calculates the sum.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Function with Arbitrary Keyword Arguments (`**kwargs`)**\n",
        "\n",
        "If you don't know how many keyword arguments will be passed, you can use `**kwargs` to collect them into a dictionary.\n",
        "\n",

        "# age: 30\n",
        "# city: New York\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, `**kwargs` allows you to pass any number of keyword arguments, and they are collected into a dictionary (`kwargs`), which can be iterated over.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **Lambda Functions (Anonymous Functions)**\n",
        "\n",
        "Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions defined using the `lambda` keyword. They are often used for short-term operations that can be written in a single line.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Definition:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",

        "result = add(3, 4)  # Output: 7\n",
        "print(result)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Lambda functions are typically used for short, throwaway functions, such as when passing a simple function to `map()`, `filter()`, or `sorted()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. **Function Inside a Function (Nested Function)**\n",
        "\n",
        "You can define functions within other functions. The inner function is called a **nested function** and has access to variables from the outer function's scope.\n",
        "\n",

        "        return y * 2\n",
        "    return inner_function(x) + 5\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Call:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "result = outer_function(3)  # Output: 11\n",
        "print(result)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, `inner_function` is defined inside `outer_function`, and it can access the argument `x` from the outer function.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. **Recursive Function (Calling Itself)**\n",
        "\n",
        "A recursive function is a function that calls itself in order to solve a problem, usually by breaking the problem into smaller subproblems.\n",
        "\n",

        "        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Call:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The `factorial` function calls itself with a smaller argument until it reaches the base case (`n == 0`).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10. **Function with Variable Number of Parameters**\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "These techniques provide flexibility in how you define and interact with functions in Python. Each has its own use case depending on the problem you're solving and how you need to structure your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "\n",
        "The `return` statement in a Python function is used to **exit** the function and **send a value** back to the caller. It essentially determines the result of the function and allows the function to provide output, which can then be used elsewhere in your program.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Purpose of the `return` Statement:\n",
        "1. **Exit the Function**: When a `return` statement is executed, the function immediately stops executing, and control is transferred back to the point where the function was called.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Return a Value**: You can return a value (or object) from the function using `return`. The value returned can then be assigned to a variable, used in expressions, or passed as an argument to other functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Syntax:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def function_name(parameters):\n",

        "\n",
        "- `value` is the value that the function returns. It can be any valid Python object, including integers, strings, lists, dictionaries, or even other functions.\n",

        "### Examples of `return` in Python Functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Returning a Simple Value**\n",
        "   A function can return a simple value like an integer, string, or boolean.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def add(a, b):\n",
        "    return a + b\n",

        "result = add(3, 4)\n",
        "print(result)  # Output: 7\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, `return a + b` causes the function to exit and return the sum of `a` and `b` to the caller. The caller stores this returned value in the `result` variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Returning Multiple Values (Tuple)**\n",
        "   A function can return multiple values by separating them with commas. Python automatically packs them into a tuple.\n",

        "Here, the function `create_list` returns a list, which is assigned to the variable `my_list`.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Return None (Implicit Return)**\n",
        "   If a function does not explicitly return a value, Python automatically returns `None`. This is often the case in functions that perform actions (like printing or modifying a global variable) but don't need to return a value.\n",

        "print(result)  # Output: Odd\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the function returns `\"Even\"` or `\"Odd\"` depending on whether the input `number` is even or odd.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 6. **Early Return (Exiting the Function Early)**\n",
        "   You can use the `return` statement to exit a function early, often in the case of error handling or when certain conditions are met.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def divide(a, b):\n",
        "    if b == 0:\n",

        "\n",
        "print(divide(10, 0))  # Output: Error: Division by zero\n",
        "print(divide(10, 2))  # Output: 5.0\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, if `b == 0`, the function returns an error message and exits early, without performing the division.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points about `return`:\n",
        "1. **Exits the Function**: When `return` is executed, the function terminates, and the program control returns to where the function was called.\n",
        "2. **Optional Return**: If no `return` is specified, the function returns `None` by default.\n",
        "3. **Single Return Value**: A function can return only one value. However, this value can be a complex data structure (like a tuple, list, or dictionary) that contains multiple items.\n",
        "4. **Multiple `return` Statements**: A function can have multiple `return` statements, but only one `return` will be executed. The function will exit when any `return` is hit, and no further code in the function will be executed after that.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Examples to Summarize:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Without `return` (implicitly returns `None`):\n",

        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "The `return` statement is essential for making functions more flexible and useful. It allows functions to produce output and pass information back to the caller, enabling complex functionality and facilitating code reuse. Without `return`, a function is limited to performing tasks without yielding any result.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, **iterables** and **iterators** are related but distinct concepts. Let's break them down:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Iterable:**\n",
        "An **iterable** is any object in Python that can return an **iterator**. In other words, an iterable is an object that you can loop over (like using a `for` loop).\n",
        "\n",
        "Key properties of iterables:\n",
        "- They implement the `__iter__()` method, which returns an **iterator**.\n",
        "- Common examples of iterables include lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of an iterable:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "\n",
        "# Checking if it's iterable\n",
        "print(hasattr(my_list, '__iter__'))  # True\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Iterator:**\n",
        "An **iterator** is an object that represents a stream of data and provides a way to access elements one at a time. An iterator is an object that implements the `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods:\n",
        "- The `__iter__()` method returns the iterator itself (this allows iterators to be used in `for` loops).\n",
        "- The `__next__()` method returns the next item in the sequence. When there are no more items, it raises the `StopIteration` exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of an iterator:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",

        "print(next(iterator))  # 3\n",
        "# print(next(iterator))  # This will raise StopIteration\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Differences:\n",
        "- **Iterable**: An object that can be iterated over (like a list, string, etc.). It can return an iterator when `iter()` is called on it.\n",
        "- **Iterator**: An object that produces the next value in a sequence and keeps track of its current position in that sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How they differ in behavior:\n",
        "- An **iterable** is a container that holds multiple items. For example, a list is an iterable.\n",
        "- An **iterator** is an object that **remembers the state** (its position) and can retrieve the next element from the iterable, one at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Can you convert an iterable to an iterator?\n",
        "Yes, you can convert an iterable to an iterator by using the `iter()` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of this conversion:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "my_iterable = [10, 20, 30]\n",
        "my_iterator = iter(my_iterable)  # Converts the iterable to an iterator\n",
        "\n",
        "# Now you can use the iterator to access elements\n",
        "print(next(my_iterator))  # 10\n",
        "print(next(my_iterator))  # 20\n",
        "print(next(my_iterator))  # 30\n",
        "# print(next(my_iterator))  # This will raise StopIteration\n",

        "### Summary of key methods:\n",
        "- **Iterable**:\n",

        "  - Examples: List, tuple, string, set, etc.\n",
        "- **Iterator**:\n",
        "  - Has both `__iter__()` (returns the iterator) and `__next__()` (returns the next item) methods.\n",

        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What are Generators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A **generator** in Python is a special type of iterable that allows you to iterate over a sequence of values lazily, i.e., one value at a time, without storing the entire sequence in memory. This makes generators more memory-efficient than other iterables like lists, especially for large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators are a way to **create iterators** using a simple and concise syntax. They are defined using a function or a generator expression.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Generators Work\n",
        "\n",
        "When a generator function is called, it returns a generator **iterator** but does not start execution immediately. When you iterate over the generator (e.g., in a `for` loop), it starts executing the code inside the generator function **from the start** until it hits a `yield` statement. At that point, the function **pauses**, returns the yielded value, and maintains its state. On subsequent iterations, the function **resumes execution** from where it left off, continuing until the next `yield` or until the function terminates.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Characteristics of Generators:\n",
        "- **Laziness**: Generators produce items one by one and only when requested (i.e., they are lazy).\n",
        "- **Memory Efficiency**: Since values are generated one at a time, generators do not store the entire sequence in memory.\n",
        "- **State Preservation**: The state of the function (local variables, the position of execution) is preserved across multiple calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Generators Are Defined\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Using a Generator Function**:\n",
        "   A generator function is defined like a regular Python function, but it uses the `yield` keyword instead of `return` to yield values one at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "   #### Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def my_generator():\n",
        "       yield 1\n",
        "       yield 2\n",
        "       yield 3\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Create a generator object\n",
        "   gen = my_generator()\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Iterate over the generator\n",
        "   for value in gen:\n",
        "       print(value)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   Output:\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   1\n",
        "   2\n",
        "   3\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - When you call `my_generator()`, it returns a generator object.\n",
        "   - The `for` loop consumes the generator, triggering the function to run from the start, and each time it hits a `yield`, it returns the corresponding value.\n",
        "   - The generator \"pauses\" at each `yield` and resumes execution when requested.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Using Generator Expressions**:\n",
        "   Generator expressions are a concise way to create generators, similar to list comprehensions but using parentheses `()` instead of square brackets `[]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "   #### Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   gen_expr = (x * x for x in range(1, 4))\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Iterate over the generator expression\n",
        "   for value in gen_expr:\n",
        "       print(value)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   Output:\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   1\n",
        "   4\n",
        "   9\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - This example creates a generator expression that yields the square of each number in the range from 1 to 3.\n",
        "   - Like regular generator functions, this generator is lazy and computes the next value only when needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Important Points About Generators\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Memory Efficiency**: Since generators yield values one at a time, they are highly memory efficient and are ideal when dealing with large datasets or streams of data that don't fit entirely in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **One-Time Use**: Generators are exhausted once they are iterated over. After all values are yielded, any subsequent attempt to iterate will raise a `StopIteration` exception. To reuse a generator, you need to create a new one.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **State Preservation**: The generator function maintains its state (variables and execution point) between yields. This allows the function to \"remember\" where it left off each time it is called.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example: A Fibonacci Generator\n",
        "\n",
        "A common example is a generator that produces the Fibonacci sequence:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def fibonacci(n):\n",
        "    a, b = 0, 1\n",
        "    for _ in range(n):\n",
        "        yield a\n",
        "        a, b = b, a + b\n",
        "\n",
        "# Create a generator for the first 5 Fibonacci numbers\n",
        "fib_gen = fibonacci(5)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Print each Fibonacci number\n",
        "for number in fib_gen:\n",
        "    print(number)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Output:\n",
        "```\n",
        "0\n",
        "1\n",
        "1\n",
        "2\n",
        "3\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case:\n",
        "- The `fibonacci` function is a generator that yields the next Fibonacci number on each iteration.\n",
        "- After `yield a`, the state (values of `a` and `b`) is saved, and when the next iteration occurs, it continues from where it left off.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Advantages of Generators:\n",
        "1. **Memory Efficient**: Since they produce items one at a time and don't store the entire sequence, they are much more memory efficient, especially when working with large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
        "2. **Lazy Evaluation**: They compute values only when needed, which can lead to faster execution for certain tasks (e.g., reading large files).\n",
        "3. **Cleaner Code**: The generator syntax is more concise and can often replace more complex iterator classes with simpler code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "- A **generator** is a special type of iterator in Python that allows you to iterate through values lazily.\n",
        "- You can define generators using **functions with `yield`** or **generator expressions**.\n",
        "- **`yield`** allows the generator to pause and return a value, and continue execution when the next value is requested.\n",
        "- Generators are **memory-efficient**, **lazy**, and **stateful**.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators offer several advantages over regular functions, particularly when dealing with large datasets or scenarios where you need to produce a sequence of values on demand. Below are the key advantages of using **generators** over regular functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Memory Efficiency**\n",
        "   - **Generators** produce values one at a time and do not store the entire sequence in memory, making them highly memory-efficient.\n",
        "   - **Regular functions**, on the other hand, typically return the entire result all at once (for example, as a list or other collection), which can be memory-intensive, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "   If you need to process a million records, a generator will only store one record in memory at a time, while a regular function might load all records into memory, consuming more resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Lazy Evaluation**\n",
        "   - **Generators** use **lazy evaluation**, meaning they compute values only when needed (on-demand). This can significantly reduce the time it takes to start processing, as it doesn't need to compute the entire sequence up front.\n",
        "   - In **regular functions**, the result is often computed and stored all at once, which may be unnecessary if only a subset of the results is needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "   When iterating through a generator, it computes the next value only when `next()` is called or when iterated over. This is in contrast to a regular function that might compute all the values ahead of time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Handling Infinite Sequences**\n",
        "   - **Generators** are ideal for working with **infinite sequences** because they can produce values indefinitely without running out of memory.\n",
        "   - **Regular functions** would typically fail when trying to generate an infinite sequence since they would need to store all the values in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "   A generator can be used to generate an infinite sequence, such as the Fibonacci sequence, without worrying about running out of memory or time, because it produces one number at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def infinite_fibonacci():\n",
        "       a, b = 0, 1\n",
        "       while True:\n",
        "           yield a\n",
        "           a, b = b, a + b\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Cleaner and More Readable Code**\n",
        "   - **Generators** provide a more **compact and readable** way to produce an iterator compared to using a class-based iterator (or using explicit loops with lists). They reduce boilerplate code and simplify the logic.\n",
        "   - In contrast, **regular functions** often require more complex logic when the task involves returning multiple values over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "   A generator that yields squares of numbers from 1 to 3:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def square_numbers():\n",
        "       for i in range(1, 4):\n",
        "           yield i * i\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   This is simpler and more readable than a traditional function that collects all results in a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **State Preservation**\n",
        "   - **Generators** automatically preserve their state (local variables, the execution point) between calls. This allows them to remember where they left off each time the generator is resumed, making them useful for long-running computations or algorithms that need to maintain context between iterations.\n",
        "   - **Regular functions** typically don’t preserve state between invocations unless you explicitly manage state with external variables or objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "   A generator can maintain the state of its execution automatically across calls, which simplifies the logic and removes the need for manual state management.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Faster Initial Execution**\n",
        "   - **Generators** allow for **faster initial execution** since they don’t require the entire sequence to be created at once. The function will start yielding values immediately without having to calculate everything in advance.\n",
        "   - With **regular functions**, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex computations, the time to prepare all results might delay the start of processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "   A generator can start iterating over a sequence immediately, whereas a regular function might need to first create and return a fully computed result.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **Simplified Concurrency**\n",
        "   - **Generators** can be used with techniques like **coroutines** (using `yield` in conjunction with `async`/`await`) for efficient, non-blocking concurrency.\n",
        "   - **Regular functions** don’t have the ability to pause and resume execution like generators, making them less suited for asynchronous tasks or cooperative multitasking.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "   Generators enable more efficient iteration over data that might otherwise require manual handling of asynchronous tasks or complex threading.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. **Reduction in Overhead**\n",
        "   - **Generators** have less **overhead** compared to regular functions that return large collections, as the computation is done on-demand.\n",
        "   - **Regular functions** might have higher overhead due to the need to create and return a full collection, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary of Advantages:\n",
        "- **Memory Efficiency**: Generates items on demand without storing the entire sequence in memory.\n",
        "- **Lazy Evaluation**: Values are computed only when needed, improving performance and reducing startup time.\n",
        "- **Infinite Sequences**: Suitable for generating infinite sequences without running out of memory.\n",
        "- **Cleaner Code**: More concise and readable compared to other methods (e.g., using a class-based iterator).\n",
        "- **State Preservation**: Automatically keeps track of its state between calls.\n",
        "- **Faster Execution**: Can start processing immediately without waiting for the entire sequence to be created.\n",
        "- **Concurrency**: Can be used effectively with asynchronous programming models.\n",
        "- **Lower Overhead**: Generates values with less computational overhead compared to creating full data structures upfront.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "Generators provide a powerful and efficient way to handle iteration over large or infinite sequences. They offer distinct advantages over regular functions, especially in terms of memory efficiency, performance, and code simplicity. While regular functions are useful for computing values in a typical manner, generators excel in situations where lazy evaluation and state preservation are beneficial.\n",

        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is a Lambda Function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A **lambda function** in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the `lambda` keyword. Unlike regular functions that are defined using the `def` keyword, lambda functions are typically used for short, throwaway functions that don't need to be named.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lambda functions are **inline functions** that can have any number of arguments but only one expression. The result of the expression is automatically returned by the lambda function.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Syntax of a Lambda Function:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "lambda arguments: expression\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- `lambda` is the keyword that defines the function.\n",
        "- `arguments` is the list of parameters that the lambda function accepts (can be zero or more).\n",
        "- `expression` is a single expression that is evaluated and returned by the lambda function. This expression is the body of the lambda function.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# A simple lambda function that adds two numbers\n",
        "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
        "\n",
        "print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, `lambda x, y: x + y` is a function that takes two arguments (`x` and `y`) and returns their sum. You can call it like a regular function using `add(3, 5)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### When to Use Lambda Functions\n",
        "\n",
        "Lambda functions are typically used in situations where:\n",
        "1. **A simple function is needed temporarily**: Lambda functions are useful when you need a simple function for a short period and don't want to define a full function using `def`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Functions as arguments**: Lambda functions are often used as arguments to higher-order functions (i.e., functions that accept other functions as arguments), especially in functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Improving code readability**: When a function is small and clear, using a lambda can make the code more concise and readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Common Use Cases for Lambda Functions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Sorting**:\n",
        "   Lambda functions are frequently used with sorting functions like `sorted()` to specify the key by which to sort.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Sorting a list of tuples by the second element\n",
        "   data = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 0)]\n",
        "   sorted_data = sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[1])\n",
        "   print(sorted_data)  # Output: [(5, 0), (1, 2), (3, 4)]\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Mapping**:\n",
        "   Lambda functions are often used with the `map()` function, which applies a function to each item in a sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "   squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))\n",
        "   print(squared)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Filtering**:\n",
        "   Lambda functions are used with `filter()` to filter elements of a sequence based on a condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
        "   even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\n",
        "   print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Reducing**:\n",
        "   With `reduce()` (from the `functools` module), lambda functions can be used to accumulate results over an iterable.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   from functools import reduce\n",
        "   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "   product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers)\n",
        "   print(product)  # Output: 24\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Lambda with Conditional Expressions**:\n",
        "   Lambda functions can also include conditional expressions, enabling simple conditional logic in one line.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Lambda with conditional expression\n",
        "   result = lambda x: \"Even\" if x % 2 == 0 else \"Odd\"\n",
        "   print(result(5))  # Output: Odd\n",
        "   print(result(4))  # Output: Even\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Advantages of Lambda Functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Concise**: Lambda functions are generally shorter and more concise than using a full function defined with `def`, making them ideal for simple operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Anonymous**: Since lambda functions are anonymous, they are useful when you need a function for a short duration and don't need to reuse it elsewhere in the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Functional Programming Support**: Lambda functions allow you to use functional programming techniques like passing functions as arguments to other functions (`map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations of Lambda Functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Single Expression**: A lambda function can only contain one expression. It cannot contain statements, multiple expressions, or complex logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **No Named Variables**: Since lambda functions are anonymous, they lack the ability to define variables or have a function name that can be used for debugging or introspection.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Readability**: While lambdas can be concise, overusing them or using them for complex logic can harm code readability, especially for people who are unfamiliar with lambda functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of a More Complex Lambda Function:\n",

        "### Purpose of the `map()` Function in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "The **`map()`** function in Python is a built-in function that allows you to apply a given function to each item in an iterable (such as a list, tuple, etc.) and return a new iterator that produces the results. This can be useful for transforming data, especially when you want to apply the same operation or transformation to each element of a sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Syntax of `map()`\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "map(function, iterable, ...)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`function`**: A function that will be applied to each item of the iterable. This can be a regular function or a lambda function.\n",
        "- **`iterable`**: An iterable (e.g., list, tuple) whose items will be passed to the function.\n",
        "- You can pass multiple iterables to `map()`, in which case the function must take as many arguments as there are iterables.\n",
        "\n",
        "The result of `map()` is an **iterator** that produces the results of applying the function to each item in the iterable. You can convert the result into a list or another collection type if you want to see the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Basic Example\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "### Key Characteristics of `map()`\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Returns an Iterator**:\n",
        "   - `map()` returns an iterator, not a list. This means that you need to convert it to a list (or another collection type) if you want to see the results immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Applies Function to Each Element**:\n",
        "   - The function you pass to `map()` is applied to each item in the iterable(s) individually, allowing you to easily transform data in a sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Can Accept Multiple Iterables**:\n",
        "   - You can pass multiple iterables to `map()`, and the function you provide should accept as many arguments as there are iterables. The iterables are processed in parallel, with the function being applied to corresponding elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Lazy Evaluation**:\n",
        "   - The result of `map()` is an iterator, so the function is only applied when you iterate over the result. This makes `map()` more memory-efficient, especially for large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Advantages of Using `map()`\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Efficiency**: `map()` is often faster and more memory-efficient than using a `for` loop because it uses lazy evaluation and avoids creating intermediate collections.\n",
        "- **Cleaner Code**: It provides a more functional approach, avoiding explicit loops and making the code more concise.\n",
        "- **Parallel Application**: When working with multiple iterables, `map()` applies the function to corresponding elements in parallel, which is very useful for tasks like element-wise arithmetic or combining data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Alternative: Using List Comprehension\n",
        "\n",
        "A common alternative to `map()` is **list comprehension**, which can sometimes be more readable. For example, the following two snippets are equivalent:\n",

        "- **Purpose**: Apply a function to each item in an iterable (or multiple iterables) and return an iterator with the results.\n",
        "- **Syntax**: `map(function, iterable, ...)`\n",
        "- **Returns**: An iterator that yields the results of applying the function.\n",
        "- **Use Cases**:\n",
        "  - Data transformation (e.g., modifying all elements of a list).\n",
        "  - Applying a function to multiple iterables in parallel.\n",
        "  - Efficient processing of large datasets through lazy evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, `map()` is useful for performing transformations on sequences of data when you want to avoid explicit loops and when the transformation can be expressed as a function.\n",

        "10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The functions `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` are all higher-order functions in Python that allow you to operate on iterables in a functional programming style. They are used to apply a function to sequences of data, but they have different purposes and behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s a detailed comparison of these three functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **`map()` Function**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Purpose:\n",
        "- The `map()` function applies a given function to **every item** of an iterable (or multiple iterables) and returns an **iterator** that yields the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Syntax:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "map(function, iterable, ...)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Characteristics:\n",
        "- **Transforms** each element of an iterable by applying the provided function.\n",
        "- Can accept **multiple iterables**; the function passed to `map()` must accept as many arguments as there are iterables.\n",
        "- Returns an **iterator**, so you must convert it to a list, tuple, etc., if you want to view the results immediately.\n",
        "- The function is applied to each element independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Using map to square each number in a list\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Characteristics:\n",
        "- **Filters** the elements of the iterable using the provided function.\n",
        "- The function should return `True` or `False` for each element of the iterable. Only elements for which the function returns `True` are kept in the result.\n",

        "- It's used when you want to **select** a subset of elements from an iterable based on a condition.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Purpose:\n",
        "- The `reduce()` function applies a **binary function** cumulatively to the items of an iterable (from left to right), so as to reduce the iterable to a **single value** (e.g., a sum, product, maximum, etc.).\n",

        "#### Syntax:\n",

        "#### Characteristics:\n",
        "- **Reduces** the iterable to a single value by applying the binary function.\n",
        "- The function passed to `reduce()` must accept **two arguments** (hence \"binary function\").\n",
        "- Optionally, you can provide an **initial value**, which is used as the starting point for the reduction. If not provided, the first element of the iterable is used as the initial value.\n",
        "- Returns the final result after applying the function to all elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from functools import reduce\n",
